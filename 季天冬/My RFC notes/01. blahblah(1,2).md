## some terminology

multipoint relay (MPR) ,  A node which is selected by its 1-hop neighbor

multipoint relay selector (MPR selector, MS),  A node which has selected its 1-hop neighbor

 symmetric link, A verified bi-directional link between two OLSR interfaces

## core functioning

1. Packet Format and Forwarding
2. Link Sensing，through HELLO messages
3. Neighbor detection, through multiple interface declaration (MID) messages
4. MPR Selection and MPR Signaling, purely algorithm maybe!
5. Topology Control Message Diffusion, Topology Control(TC) message are diffused for the route to calculate.
6. Route Calculation.
